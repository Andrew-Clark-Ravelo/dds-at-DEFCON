# Bricks In The Air Workshop Files

In order to encourage more people to become interested in investigating aircraft vulnerabilities as well as understand the problems aircraft face, Bricks in the Air attempts to represent this problem in a simple and jargon free manner.  By replacing the complex and unfamiliar 1553/429 buses with the more well known I2C data bus, we remove a lot of the jargon and confusion of the problem while allowing attendees to understand the core problem: Aircraft data buses are old and unsecure, and someone should fix that.  

As a part of the modifications for Safe Mode a twitch chat will act as a replacement for the I2C link to the kit.  As such the user will enter I2C commands via the IRC chat of the hosting Twitch channel instead of their serial terminal.
