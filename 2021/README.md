# DEFCON 29 (2021)

One day we'll learn, but not today.  DDS is back for its third year at DEFCON, once again hanging out at the aerospace village.  This year we're trying to keep things simple and lighthearted.  In light of 2021 being the year that billionaires decided to leave our planet, we're allowing you the chance to get away and explore the great unknown.  Whether playing in person or at home, try and take control of our web enabled rover and explore the wonders of a random corner of the Paris ballroom.
