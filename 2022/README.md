# DEFCON 30 (2022)

It's time to party like its 1993.  In celebration of DEFCON hitting the big 30, DDS is going all in this year, with a main stage talk on satellite jamming, two workshops for the aerospace village, and a brand new workshop at the ICS village, done in partnership with the US Army and Lawrence Berkeley National Labs.  Will we survive all this, probably not, but feel free to swing by either of the villages anyway.
