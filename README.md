DDS aviation and space workshops at DEFCON

## CPX Simple Sat

Created as a part of the [Aerospace Village](https://aerospacevillage.org/) for DEFCON28 (Rest in Safe Mode), CPX Simple Sat attempts to teach the basics of satellite exploitation with a ground station in an easily approachable and jargon free manor. Access the workshop files here: [CPX Simple Sat](https://github.com/deptofdefense/dds-at-DEFCON/tree/master/CPX-simplesat)

## Bricks In The Air Workshop Files

In order to encourage more people to become interested in investigating aircraft vulnerabilities as well as understand the problems aircraft face, Bricks in the Air attempts to represent this problem in a simple and jargon free manner.  By replacing the complex and unfamiliar 1553/429 buses with the more well known I2C data bus, we remove a lot of the jargon and confusion of the problem while allowing attendees to understand the core problem: Aircraft data buses are old and unsecure, and someone should fix that.
