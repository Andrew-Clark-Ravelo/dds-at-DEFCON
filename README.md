# dds-at-DEFCON
For the second year, the Defense Digital Service is partnering with the United States Air Force to participate in Aerospace Village at DEF CON 28. This year we have expanded our scope beyond aviation to include space, specifically satellites! In addition to hosting the 2020 Space Security Challenge, the first-ever Hack-A-Satellite CTF at DEF CON, we are also bringing a series of interactive workshops to DEF CON in complete Safemode.

We have created a vibrant, web-based virtual reality environment for you to interact with each of our workshops. Access our virtual workshops at [dds-virtual.com](https://dds-virtual.com/), otherwise, see below for the deets on game play for each of the work shops!

# Documentation for Gameplay

## Aviation Hacking Workshops: Bricks In The Air 

In order to encourage more people to become interested in investigating aircraft vulnerabilities as well as understand the problems aircraft face, Bricks in the Air attempts to represent this problem in a simple and jargon free manner.  By replacing the complex and unfamiliar 1553/429 buses with the more well known I2C data bus, we remove a lot of the jargon and confusion of the problem while allowing attendees to understand the core problem: Aircraft data buses are old and unsecure, and someone should fix that.

## Satellite Hacking Workshops: CPX Simple Sat, DDSAT-1, & NyanDat

- CPX Simple Sat attempts to teach the basics of satellite exploitation with a ground station in an easily approachable and jargon free manor. Access the workshop files here: [CPX Simple Sat](https://github.com/deptofdefense/dds-at-DEFCON/tree/master/CPX-simplesat)
- DDSat-1 focuses on showing the problems with how many of the control messages for satellites are either naturally unencrypted, or kick to an unencrypted mode should the satellite not be able to communicate with the ground station. Access workshop files here: [DDSAT-1](https://github.com/deptofdefense/dds-at-DEFCON/tree/master/DDSAT-1)
- The Nyansat workshop consists of three challenges: 
  - DIY Tracking Antenna: Participants will build their own tracking antennas, which they can use to receive signals from satellites or terrestrial sources.  
  - Hacking a Ground Station Modem: Red Balloon is making available a standard 56k modem used by satellite ground stations, so participants can learn about the state of ground station security and see how an attacker could exploit these devices..  
  - Public, Live Streamed Ground Station: Red Balloon has constructed a working ground station that can receive data from thousands of satellites. They will be turning control of this station over to the DEFCON community, and livestreaming a Q&amp;A, panel discussions, and of course, live data received by the antenna.
