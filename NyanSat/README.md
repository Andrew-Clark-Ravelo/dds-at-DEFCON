# NyanSat
The Nyansat workshop consists of three challenges:

- DIY Tracking Antenna: Participants will build their own tracking antennas, which they can use to receive signals from satellites or terrestrial sources.  
- Hacking a Ground Station Modem: Red Balloon is making available a standard 56k modem used by satellite ground stations, so participants can learn about the state of ground station security and see how an attacker could exploit these devices..  
- Public, Live Streamed Ground Station: Red Balloon has constructed a working ground station that can receive data from thousands of satellites. They will be turning control of this station over to the DEFCON community, and livestreaming a Q&amp;A, panel discussions, and of course, live data received by the antenna.
